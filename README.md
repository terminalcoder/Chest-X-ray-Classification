# Chest-X-ray-Classification

September 2023

## Overview
This report aims to construct an image classification model capable of accurately diagnosing pneumonia in pediatric patients, from chest X-ray images. Utilizing an iterative aproach, a convolutional neural network capable of identifying 91% of pneumonial scans present in the test group of the images, emerges as the most performant model.

## Context
A model capable of classifying chest X-rays as either normal or displaying evidence of pneumonia would enable medical professionals to delegate reading such scans to an automated system thereby attaining greater efficiency in healthcare. Additionaly, such a tool may prove useful in detecting disease in patients whose scan abnormality is slight enough to be overlooked by even trained medical technicians.

## Data
The images used for this project come from the Kaggle Chest X-raay (Pneumonia) Datseta....isin'y that awesome
